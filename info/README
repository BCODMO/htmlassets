APPLICATION = info
============================================================

The info routine is a Perl CGI script used by the JGOFS/GLOBEC
data management software to display metadata about the
selected data object (dataset). The routine uses a separate
Perl subroutine (getinfor.pl) to get the metadata information
from the metadata database. If no information is available
from the metadata database, info will look for a .info text
file in the same sub-directory as the JGOFS/GLOBEC .objects
entry. The getinfor.pl script formats the metadata and returns
it to the info routine to display as a web page.
