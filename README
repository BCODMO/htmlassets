This web resource defined in the Apache config is used for serving HTML code such as
Javascript, CSS, images and/or other files. The purpose is to decrease the maintenance
for distributed applications that may run on multiplde servers but using similar code 
bases. These systems may all want to run the exact same javascript or CSS and instead 
of copying those HTML code resources to every distributed web server, we host those 
resources on this VirtualHost available for use by all.
